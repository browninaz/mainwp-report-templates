# MainWP Pro Report Templates
This is the repo for Pink Lizard Web custom MainWP report templates. 

After scouring the internet for template ideas, it seems that there are few independant developers or agencies that have used or shared MainWP Pro Report Template ideas and designs. 

The markup and styles for templates 1 and 2 respectively belong to Joshua Vandercar at Typewheel (https://typewheel.xyz/). Thank you Joshua for posting what you have created, and for helping me with the direction needed to create personalized MainWP report templates.

Template 3 is the html written and styled from a MS Word doc, and is a Pink Lizard Web (https://www.pinklizardweb.com/) template in progress as of 11.21.2020. As of now, no templates are complete and ready to use for final output.

The Essential Business template will be the template used to send to our clients once complete and rendering properly.

I am new to code and web development, and learning this as I go. If anyone visiting this page has custom template ideas or complete designs, please message me. Any help is greatly appreciated!
