# MainWP Pro Report Templates
This is the repo for Pink Lizard Web MainWP Pro Report templates. 

After scouring the internet for template ideas, it seems there are few independant developers or agencies that have shared MainWP Pro Report Template ideas and designs. 

The ess-maint template is sent to our clients that subscribed to the essential maintenance package. This template is currently being used, but the code needs to be cleaned up and some additional styling needs done (i.e.- padding, margins, spaghetti code, etc.)

The ess-maint-mb template is sent to our clients that have websites that are too big to back up with Updraft Plus. This template,too, needs to be polished up a bit.

The goal is to customize templates to use for our clients at each maintenance package level. Once the first template is styled to satisfaction, the rest should be  pretty straight forward.

I am new to writing code and web development and learning this as I go, so the code is sloppy. Whatever, I'm having fun. 

If anyone visiting this page has custom template ideas or complete designs, please message me. Any help is greatly appreciated! Also, once these templates are complete and can be of use to you, feel free to copy! I will post an update once complete.
