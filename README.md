# MainWP Pro Report Templates
This is the repo for Pink Lizard Web MainWP Pro Report templates. 

After scouring the internet for template ideas, it seems there are few independant developers or agencies that have shared MainWP Pro Report Template ideas and designs. 

The markup and styles for jv-report-templates 1 and 2 respectively belong to Joshua Vandercar at Typewheel (https://typewheel.xyz/). This markup can be applied to the MainWP Reports body as is (not directly to the Pro Reports templates). Thank you Joshua for posting what you have created, and for helping me with the direction needed to create personalized MainWP report templates.

The plw-es-bus-no-post template is sent to our clients that subscribed to the essential maintenance package and are not having us create blog posts. This template is currently being used, but the code needs to be cleaned up and some additional styling needs done (i.e.- padding, margins, spaghetti code, etc.)

The plw-es-bus-w-post template is sent to our clients that have subscribed to the essential maintenance package and are having us create blog posts and managing comments. This template,too, needs to be polished up a bit.

The goal is to customize templates to use for our clients at each maintenance package level. Once the first template is styled to satisfaction, the rest should be  pretty straight forward.

I am new to code and web development and learning this as I go, so the code is sloppy. Regardless, I don't care, I'm having fun! If anyone visiting this page has custom template ideas or complete designs, please message me. Any help is greatly appreciated! Also, once these templates are complete and can be of use to you, feel free to copy! I will post an update once complete.
