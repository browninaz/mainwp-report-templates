# MainWP Pro Report Templates
This is the repo for Pink Lizard Web MainWP Pro Report templates. 

After scouring the internet for template ideas, it seems there are few independant developers or agencies that have shared MainWP Pro Report Template ideas and designs. 

The goal was to customize templates to use for our clients at each maintenance package level. Once the first template was styled to satisfaction, the rest were pretty straight forward.

*maint-basic = Basic maintenance package report.

*maint-ess = Essential maintenance package report.

*maint-prem = Premium maintenance package report.

*renewal-domain = Domain renewal reminder report.

*renewal-hosting-domain = Hosting and domain renewal report.

*renewal-hosting = Hosting renewal report.

Custom tokens were created in MainWP to add client specific info.

Each report is sent to our clients that subscribed to a specific maintenance plan. These templates are currently being used, but the code needs to be cleaned up and some additional styling needs done (i.e.- padding, margins, spaghetti code, etc.)


If anyone visiting this page has custom template ideas or complete designs, please message me, any help is greatly appreciated! Also, once these templates are complete and can be of use to you, feel free to copy. Hope this helps!
