# MainWP Pro Report Templates
This is the repo for Pink Lizard Web MainWP Pro Report templates. 

After scouring the internet for template ideas, it seems there are few independant developers or agencies that have shared MainWP Pro Report Template ideas and designs. 

The markup and styles for templates 1 and 2 respectively belong to Joshua Vandercar at Typewheel (https://typewheel.xyz/). This markup can be applied to the MainWP Reports body as is (not directly to the Pro Reports templates). Thank you Joshua for posting what you have created, and for helping me with the direction needed to create personalized MainWP report templates.

Template 3 is the html written and styled from a MS Word doc, and is a Pink Lizard Web (https://www.pinklizardweb.com/) template in progress as of 11.21.2020. As of now, no templates are complete and ready to use for final output.

The plw-essential-business template will be sent to clients that subscribed to the essential maintenance package once complete and rendering properly. The default template modified for this specific template is the pro-report-basic. 

The goal is to customize templates to use for clients at each maintenance package level. Once the first template is styled to satisfaction, the rest should be  pretty straight forward.

I am new to code and web development and learning this as I go. If anyone visiting this page has custom template ideas or complete designs, please message me. Any help is greatly appreciated! Also, once these templates are complete and can be of use to you, feel free to copy!
