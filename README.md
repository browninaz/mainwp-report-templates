# MainWP Report Templates
This is the repo for Pink Lizard Web custom MainWP report templates. The code for templates 1 and 2 respectively belong to Joshua Vandercar at Typewheel (https://typewheel.xyz/). Thank you Joshua for posting what you have created, and for helping us with the direction needed to create personalized MainWP report templates.

Template 3 is the html written and styled from a MS Word doc, and is a Pink Lizard Web (https://www.pinklizardweb.com/) template in progress as of 11.21.2020. As of now, no templates are complete and ready to use for the final output.
